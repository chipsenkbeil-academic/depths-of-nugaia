To Do:
-------------------------------
- Add intro movie
- Finish second level

Bugs:
-------------------------------
- Players can still do the flying grapple block trick (or as Chip calls it, the Demon Block)
- There's a small floating black dot around Nyx's head
- Bug with colliders in the simple fracture

Suggestions:
--------------------------------
- Make the goal in part 2 more obvious
- Show players the robot when they enter so they know it's coming, add music that plays when the robot gets close to the player
- Add in the animation for grappling
- Add fade in for levels


Done:
--------------------------------
- Adjust air vent velocity for the spinning robot death trap
- Move the staircase at the end of part 1 (the one directly in front of the house) to the left a little bit more so 
    players are more likely to land on it
- Fix stairs sometimes falling at beginning
- The block that players pull down should be bigger
- Light up the check points when you pass by them
- Make the blocks in part 2 smaller
- Unitilized grappling hook exception when you die
- Add more props to levels (still working on part 2)
- The robot goes through the walls in part 2 (simply fix the way points)
- Reduced the size of the robot collider
- Slow down the robot
- Player can jump the gaps in part 2 if they jump at the right time (lowered the jump height slightly)
- Elevator is still bugging out (won't go all the way down, sometimes will slowly go up until the player jumps off, ect)
- Add hair to the character model
- Add a controls menu to the main menu, possibly allow players to change key bindings (showing controls during level)
- Player shooting forward when they're swinging at high speeds
- Add in/fix the death animation
- Allow players to reattach themselves to another surface without having to detach, then reattach (referring to the 
    planks at the end of part 1)
- Make grappling the pipe and block in the beginning of part 1 more obvious 
    (someone suggested having the camera zoom out in certain parts, maybe make zooming out in general a feature?)
